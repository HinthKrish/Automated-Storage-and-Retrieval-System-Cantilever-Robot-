# Automated-Storage-and-Retrieval-System-Cantilever-Robot-
This project focuses on the development of an Automated Storage and Retrieval System (ASRS) using a cantilever-type robotic arm, designed to organize, store, and retrieve items from designated slots with precision. Ideal for warehouses, labs, and smart inventory systems, this robot minimizes human effort and improves storage efficiency.
